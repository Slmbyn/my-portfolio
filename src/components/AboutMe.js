            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hey there! I&apos;m Selam, and my journey into software development has been a bit of a zig-zag. Starting with a finance degree, I dove into the banking world, handling everything from lending to investments. I then took a detour into the wild world of day trading, learning the ropes on my own. While trading, I decided to add to my skill set by teaching myself Python thinking that it would be helpful with my trading (which it definitely is). But I accidentally became enamored with it and ended up completing an immersive software engineering bootcamp.</p>
            <p>Beyond the professional stuff, I love to socialize, travel, and can chat for hours about the Golden State Warriors and football. Fun fact? Just clinched my first-ever fantasy football league championship!
